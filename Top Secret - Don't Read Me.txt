'Top Secret', I thought that might get your attention.

Installation:
-------------
1.	Drag and Drop the Folder "X-Bomber v0.8" from WinZip into another folder on your hard disk. 
2.	Open the extracted folder and double-click on xb2-08.exe to run the program.

Changes since v0.83g:
---------------------
1.	To transform, press and hold Select 1 (Shift, by default). There is no dedicated Transform button anymore.
2.	Select 2 is now Ctrl by default, rather than \.

Performance Tips:
-----------------
1.	Make sure your PC is on mains power and that the power plan is "High performance" (7/Vista) or "Home Office/Desk" (XP).
2.	Make sure X-Bomber is running in 'change-resolution mode', (ie. press Alt+Enter when you start the game). This should give you the greatest performance level and it will preserve X-Bomber's aspect ratio if your graphics card driver settings allow it.
3.	Make sure your graphics drivers are the latest *official* versions. Usually the drivers from LaptopVideo2Go.com are great but they have caused trouble with X-Bomber on one of my systems.
4.	Make sure UTorrent is minimised to the system tray and not open in a window, if you are running it. I think UTorrent and X-Bomber must share a graphics library or something because X-Bomber suffers a substantial performance hit when a UTorrent window is open.
